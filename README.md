# Flat Earth
Create Stereographic Projection of the Earth from a World Map

**If the Jupyter Notebook does not render, go to [https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and paste the URL of the Jupyter Notebook.**

The world map image is taken from [World Maps Online](https://www.worldmapsonline.com/np_geo/world_physical.htm)

This project aims to take an image of a world map and project it onto a 2d plane using stereographic projection.
